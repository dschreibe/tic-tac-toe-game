# Project Title:
tic-tac-toe-game

## Team:
Dylan Schreiber, Jake Stinson

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a game/program that can simulate a two player tic-tac-toe. The functionality that we are aiming to achieve is the ability to play this game through a console, allowing for an easy to play game that understands the rules of the game smoothy.
## Scope:
### Inclusions:
- Ability for 2 players to participate
- Scoring system on wins and losses
- Recognition of wins, losses, ties
- Making sure you can't override a square if already played
- Creating a rubric on what the specific rules are
- Creating an aesthetic that is visually pleasing and connective for audiences
- Possible user customization regarding background, board colors, etc.

### Exclusions:
- Virtual world open space
- No need to prepare for unexpected gameplay, have knowledge of all possible moves players can do at specific times
- Complex controls
- Single player capability

## Deliverables:
- Python scripts to create the game
- Creating a visable image of the game
- Creating multiple scripts that work together to allow for authentic game representation
- Optimizing the presentation to look professional

## Timeline:
### Key Milestones:
- Create outline of tasks for the code of game (9/29)
- Implement tasks created and write tasks that came up during this time (10/6)
- Create a visable image for the game and connect it to the written code (10/20)
- Complete rough draft of game (10/27)
- Fix minor bug issues and optimize gameplay and visibility for final draft (11/7)
- Complete final draft (11/21)
- [Outline the major milestones or checkpoints throughout the project, with estimated completion dates.]

### Task Breakdown:
- Create game rules python code (3-5 hours)
- Create player-console move python code (3-5 hours)
- Create aesthetic image code (3-5 hours)
- Unexpected issues in code to fix (3-5 hours)
- Put code together to complete rough draft (2-4 hours)
- Fixing bugs and optimizing speed and visuals (2-4 hours)
- Polishing and submitting final draft (2-4 hours)
- [Create a detailed breakdown of tasks, assigning estimated hours or days to each.]

## Technical Requirements:
### Hardware:
- [Specify any hardware requirements, such as servers, networking equipment, or specific devices.]

### Software:
- [List the necessary software tools, programming languages (Python), libraries (socket, threading, etc.), and operating systems.]

## Assumptions:
- [State any assumptions that are being made about the project, such as network connectivity or availability of resources.]

## Roles and Responsibilities:
- [Define the roles of team members, including project manager, developers, testers, etc., and their responsibilities.]

## Communication Plan:
- [Outline the communication channels and frequency for project updates, meetings, and decision-making.]

## Additional Notes:
