# Project Title:
tic-tac-toe-game

## Team:
Dylan Schreiber, Jake Stinson

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a game/program that can simulate a two player tic-tac-toe. The functionality that we are aiming to achieve is the ability to play this game through a console, allowing for an easy to play game that understands the rules of the game smoothy.
## Scope:
### Inclusions:
- Ability for 2 players to participate
- Scoring system on wins and losses
- Recognition of wins, losses, ties
- Making sure you can't override a square if already played
- Creating a rubric on what the specific rules are
- Creating an aesthetic that is visually pleasing and connective for audiences
- Possible user customization regarding background, board colors, etc.

### Exclusions:
- Virtual world open space
- No need to prepare for unexpected gameplay, have knowledge of all possible moves players can do at specific times
- Complex controls
- Single player capability

## Deliverables:
- Python scripts to create the game
- Creating a visable image of the game
- Creating multiple scripts that work together to allow for authentic game representation
- Optimizing the presentation to look professional

## Timeline:
### Key Milestones:
- Create outline of tasks for the code of game (9/29)
- Implement tasks created and write tasks that came up during this time (10/6)
- Create a visable image for the game and connect it to the written code (10/20)
- Complete rough draft of game (10/27)
- Fix minor bug issues and optimize gameplay and visibility for final draft (11/7)
- Complete final draft (11/21)

### Task Breakdown:
- Create game rules python code (3-5 hours)
- Create player-console move python code (3-5 hours)
- Create aesthetic image code (3-5 hours)
- Unexpected issues in code to fix (3-5 hours)
- Put code together to complete rough draft (2-4 hours)
- Fixing bugs and optimizing speed and visuals (2-4 hours)
- Polishing and submitting final draft (2-4 hours)

## Technical Requirements:
### Hardware:
- The game will require a server and two clients
- The hardware can be low power, with the only requirement being that they have an internet connection and run Python
- The server can also run on one of the clients instead
- One computer can run both clients and servers if necessary but can also be used across computers

### Software:
- Python main programming language
- Any operating system then runs Python will work with our game
- For our game, we will be testing it on Linux, Mac, and Windows
- The project will utilize Python Sockets to connect the two clients

## Assumptions:
- We assume the players and servers will have Python installed
- We assume the players understand the rules on tic tac toe
- We assume the players have an internet connection

## Roles and Responsibilities:
- This project only has two members meaning we will have to take on multiple tasks
- Both members will create code for the project and test their code before making a pull request
- Each member will check the other members work to ensure the code is working

## Communication Plan:
- The communication plan is to talk directly to each other to ensure we both understand the requirements of the project
- Before deadlines, we will both outline what we expect from each other to make sure work is evenly divded
- We also plan to ensure to communicate any possible delays or difficulties to help each other out

## Additional Notes:
- If we have more time, we can also work on creating a more graphical experience to improve the user experience while playing our game
